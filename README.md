# system-level-performance-evaluation-of-lte-mimo-downlink

We consider a downlink transmission from one base station (BS) to multiple users (UE). The BS serves K = 10 UEs randomly and uniformly dropped (at a distance > 35m and < 250m from the BS) in a centre cell.

The transmission is subject to interference from 6 neighbouring base stations. The transmit power at each base station is ﬁxed to 46dBm. The noise variance at the UE is ﬁxed to -174dBm. The BSs are all equipped with nt = 4 transmit antennas and the UEs are equipped with either nr = 1 or 2 receive antennas.
